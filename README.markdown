Stupid Template Engine
======================

The Stupid Template Engine (STE) is a template engine for the PHP programming
language.

Requirements
------------

PHP >= 5.3

Why should you use it?
----------------------

* It's syntax (inspired by Textpattern's template syntax) is very easy and
  similar to the syntax of (X)HTML. So it should be easy for designers to learn
  this system.
* It has a simple, yet powerful plugin interface. You can easily define your
  own template functions / tags. It is even possible to write them in the
  template language itself, which makes it kind of a programming language...
* It can transcompile templates into PHP.
* You can use anonymous functions to define custom tags.

Annoying things.
----------------

* No caching. Could be slow on websites with many hits.

WARNING
-------

Early development, that means that it might be pretty buggy at the moment...
